### Compiler Explorer

The perfect C++ playground.
Allows you to compile C++ on the webbrowser and look at the resulting ASM
Has many different compilers available, great for quick sketches, testing hypothesis

### CMake
The defacto standard for building Modern C++ applications
Doesn't actually build anything; it's a meta generator that creates
your favorite build system (Ninja, make, Visual Studio Solution, Xcode)
* Cross Platform (with some work)

### Ninja

### clang-format
<3: an automatic formatter for C++
no more bike shedding, pick a set of rules and let clang-format do it for you
many hidden benefits:
* easier to read pull requests
* 0 time spent formatting code
* uniform codebase reduces cognitive load on humans

### Note on package managers
Not covered here, don't have personal experience with them.
Currently there seem to be 2 good candidates: vcpkg and Conan
